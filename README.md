This program will take in 2 inputs.
1. A list of numbers (with this format: --1,2,3,4,5) as command line argument
2. A user input for purchase price that will be a run time parameter.

After each execution, the program will prompt user to ask whether to terminate program or run again with a new purchase price.
This is to model a line of customers at a store waiting to check out - Instead of having to restart the program after 
each execution, the customer service representative can simply start a new execution with the same list of gift values.

Steps to run program:
 
1.Run "npm install" to get the required library installed.
2. Call the function with this command " node findPairs.js --1,5,6,6,12
3. Pass in list of gift values as "1,5,6,6,12". The program will convert this list into an array.
4. All output will be printed in terminal.
